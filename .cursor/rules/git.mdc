- Use Git for all version control operations.
- Each completed task or meaningful work unit must be committed separately.
- Write clear and descriptive commit messages that explain the change.
- Use present tense and imperative mood for commit messages (e.g., "Add airport search field", "Fix localization bug").
- Do not combine unrelated changes in a single commit.
- Commit all related code, assets, and tests for a task together.
- Push commits to the remote repository regularly.
- Resolve all merge conflicts before committing and pushing.
- Do not commit code that breaks the build or fails analysis/tests.
- Reference issue or task numbers in the commit message if available (e.g., "Add currency converter [#42]").
- Before starting a new task, pull the latest changes from the main branch.
- Do not commit sensitive information (API keys, passwords, credentials, etc.).
- All team members must follow these git rules consistently.
